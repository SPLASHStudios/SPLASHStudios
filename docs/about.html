    <center><p>SPLASH! is a fictional game dev company created by Marko21552 on GitHub. Did you know that the SPLASHStudios account was actually Marko21552's main account? Yeah, this account used to be Marko21552's main account called Marko2155. However, he forgot the password to it and created a new account (which is his new main) called Marko21552. When he remembered the password, he repurposed the account as a fictional game dev company run by him and that brings us to where we are today.
